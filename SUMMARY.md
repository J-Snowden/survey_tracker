# Survey Data Tracker - Implementation Summary

## Overview
This application automates the process of collecting and analyzing survey response data from an assessment platform. It logs into the platform, downloads CSV data files, processes them to extract relevant information, and generates a summary report in Excel format.

## Implemented Features

### 1. User Interface
- Tkinter-based graphical interface
- Credential input (username/password)
- URL input for assessment results pages
- Progress tracking and status updates
- Report display and folder access

### 2. Authentication Module
- Secure handling of user credentials
- Playwright-based browser automation for login
- Session management for the assessment platform
- Error handling for authentication failures

### 3. Web Automation Module
- Automated navigation to provided assessment URLs
- File download functionality
- Progress tracking during downloads
- Error handling for web operations

### 4. CSV Processing Module
- Parsing of downloaded CSV files
- Extraction of teacher IDs from student IDs (first 3 characters)
- Counting of valid responses based on data in unique test variables
- Date extraction from "End Time" column
- Data aggregation by teacher and date

### 5. Report Generation Module
- Creation of Excel reports with teacher IDs, dates, and response counts
- Professional formatting with headers and styling
- Summary statistics generation
- Automatic file naming with timestamps

## How It Meets User Requirements

### Requirement: "I upload or give the application a link or links that it goes to"
**Implementation**: The application accepts multiple URLs in the UI, which are processed sequentially.

### Requirement: "clicks a download link which will download the raw data file"
**Implementation**: The web automation module automatically navigates to each URL and clicks download buttons.

### Requirement: "automatically load the downloaded files"
**Implementation**: Downloaded files are automatically processed without user intervention.

### Requirement: "process the files giving me the desired output of the number of students per teacher that have completed the assessment"
**Implementation**: The CSV processor extracts teacher IDs and counts valid responses, which are then aggregated in the Excel report.

### Requirement: "output will be an excel file ... that has a column of teacher IDs, and then columns with dates and number of student responses"
**Implementation**: The report generator creates Excel files with exactly this structure.

## Technical Architecture

### Technologies Used
- **Playwright**: For browser automation and file downloading
- **pandas**: For efficient CSV processing and data manipulation
- **openpyxl**: For Excel report generation with formatting
- **Tkinter**: For the desktop user interface

### Data Flow
1. User provides credentials and URLs through the UI
2. Authentication module logs into the assessment platform
3. Web automation module downloads CSV files from provided URLs
4. CSV processing module extracts teacher IDs and counts responses
5. Report generation module creates Excel reports with aggregated data

## Installation and Usage

### Installation
1. Install Python 3.8 or higher
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Install Playwright browsers: `playwright install chromium`

### Usage
1. Run the application: `python main.py`
2. Enter credentials and URLs in the UI
3. Click "Start Processing"
4. View generated reports in the "reports" folder

## Testing
- Test data generator for creating sample CSV files
- Test processor for verifying CSV processing and report generation
- Manual testing recommended for web automation components

## Security Considerations
- Credentials are only stored in memory during the session
- No data is transmitted to external servers
- All processing is done locally on the user's machine

## Error Handling
- Comprehensive error handling throughout all modules
- User-friendly error messages
- Graceful degradation when possible
- Detailed logging for debugging
